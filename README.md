## Introduction
  
Welcome to the start of my portfolio! I have created this repository so as I move forward into my next programing course at Stech, I will have a place to show off the assignments and projects I complete. I will be updating the respository with projects over the next few months as I complete the course.
For the course's final project, I built A Simple Password Manager, which can be found in its own repository:

## Bio
My name is Nate, and, among other things, I am a software development student at Southwest Technical college in Southern Utah. I am also currently employed as a custodian at the college, as well as a customer service representative for Champion Powersports. I grew up in American Fork, Utah, before moving to Cedar City, Utah where I attended Southern Utah Univeristy. After I graduated, majoring in Geology and minoring in Spanish, I decided to bolster my skills and learn programming at Stech. After I finish the program, I hope to combine my knowledge set to go into Graphical Information Systems development.
